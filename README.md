# Dynamic Systems Visualization -> [live demo](https://vibration.arthurspace.com/)

## Overview
Dynamic Systems Visualization is a web application designed to simulate and visualize the vibration behavior of dynamic systems with two degrees of freedom. The application allows users to input system parameters such as mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, and then observe the system's response to initial conditions or harmonic excitation.

## Features
- **Two Degrees of Freedom System Simulation:** Users can input initial conditions and visualize system response over time.
- **Harmonic Excitation Simulation:** Allows users to apply harmonic forces and analyze the system's oscillatory response.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can modify mass, damping, and stiffness matrices to explore different system behaviors.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Real-time plotting of system responses with interactive graphs.
